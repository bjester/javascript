/**
 * Create a Collection prototype that can act as an array, but isn't.
 * 
 * 1. Create the constructor and prototype
 * 2. Add a log() method that will log each member of itself independently,
 *    along with its type.  
 * 3. The log() method should accept one arg that is a reference to the logging 
 *    function.  It should default to console.log
 * 4. Override the join method, and make it always prepend the string
 *    'Collection: '
