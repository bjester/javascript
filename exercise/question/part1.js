/**
 * Create a prototype that you can create new objects, with or without 'new'
 * 
 * 1. Call the prototype Animal
 * 2. It should accept one constructor arg, 'name'
 * 3. It should have a method, eat() that accepts a string 'name' or another 
 *    Animal and return 'this' for chaining
 * 4. It should have a method, whatDidIEat() that console.log what it ate, 
 *    recursively. If it ate a bird who ate a worm who ate dirt, then output 
 *    something like that (the wording is as important as the class structure)
